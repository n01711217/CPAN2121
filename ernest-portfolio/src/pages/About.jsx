      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Ernest Ovbiookun. I’m a passionate and focused computer programming student at Humber College.
        With a background in engineering and years of hands-on technical experience, I’m now building my career in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year, I’ve worked on several academic and personal coding projects using Java, Python, JavaScript,
        React, and Node.js. I enjoy solving problems, creating user-friendly interfaces, and continuously learning new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m particularly interested in full-stack development and mobile applications, and I’m currently building real-world projects
        that showcase my growth and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I value fitness, creativity, and discipline. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and I’m always
        open to new collaborations and challenges.
      </p>
